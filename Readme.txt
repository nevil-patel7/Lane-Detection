The following dependencies are required to run the code:
--> matplotlib
--> numpy 
--> scipy

--> Goto "Code" folder
--> Copy-Paste the "Night Drive - 2689" in the folder
--> Copy-Paste the dataset folders in the folder (data_1 and data_2)
--> After providing all the required datasets the Code folder should have the following:
	data_1 ( All the images for this dataset should be in a folder "data" as it was provided to us )
	data_2 ( It should have the challenge_video.mp4 as provided to us )
	Night Drive - 2689
	lane_detection.py
	functions.py
	Problem1.py


For Problem-1 Solution:
	-->Run Problem1.py
	-->Choose to generate an output video(1) or just visualize the output(0) and press Enter

For Problem-2 Solution:
	--> Run lane_detection.py
	--> Choose the dataset you want the output for. (1 or 2)
	--> Choose to generate an output video(1) or just visualize the output(0) and press Enter

 
The output videos will be saved to the same "Code" folder.
