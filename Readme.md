## Overview

Lane detection is an important aspect of self-driving vehicles. With   Acme   robotics   entering   the   autonomous   delivery   business,  delivery   vehicles   should   be   smart   enough   and   able   to   navigate   roads  effortlessly. Smart Lane is a lane detection module that can be integrated with the other modules onboard a self driving car. This project has been developed as a part of the ENPM808X-Software Development course for midterm project. 

A quick overview of the algorithm is as follows:

- Filter   and   segment   the   input   image   to   get   a   rough   estimate   of   the  lanes.
- Perform region of interest (ROI) extraction for filtering out false positives.
- Perspective transformations for getting lane slopes and curves.
- Overlay lane lines and calculate heading direction to output.
- Provides display of DriveHeading to the actuator to move in right, left, or straight. 
- Output is an video which will show the area inside the lane and will assist controller to move the mechanism to right or left.
 
## Algorithm Process and Output Results 

This software project enables us to use data from camera of any car and provide lane assistance to the controller. It takes in colorful image of road and surrounding. And provides output of turning angle, lane detection and turning side. It takes input image as follows.
## INPUT IMAGE
![](images/ColorImage.jpg)


This input frame is first undistorted. Later this image processes the yellow lane on the left by converting whole image into HSV (to reduce effect of change in ambient light). Then it takes in yellow color values. With which it compares values of all pixels in the image. And we get the following output.
## YELLOW THRESHOLD IMAGE
![](images/YellowThreshold.jpg)

Additionally, we convert original image to grayscale image and then find white lane. Output of white lane is shown below.
## WHITE THRESHOLD IMAGE
![](images/WhiteThresholdImage.jpg)

We merge both the images and get resultant image. Now if we define our region of interest we will be able to eliminate noise above lower half. This is be the fact that lane can not go above half the area.
## COMBINED IMAGE
![](images/CombinedThresholdImage.jpg)

And finally, after getting points we plot polygon curves where other elements of matrix(Mask matrix) are zero and elements under polygon are 1's To get our desired Region of interest we do bitwise_And so that final matrix will have white elements inside the ROI only. So final output of a frame will be as shown.
## COMBINED with ROI IMAGE
![](images/ROIImage.jpg)

To calculate exact angles we need do transformation so that we can see Lane parallel and can calculated exact angles for driveheading and which will give correct angles to controller to stear right or left.
## SLIDING WINDOW IMAGE
![](images/SlidingWindow.jpg)

We use sliding window method to find both lane points through out the frame to calculate lines . So output of this method is shown as below. Here in image we can see line plotted with the help of points.
## SLIDING WINDOW WITH LINES IMAGE
![](images/LanesPerspective.jpg)

On terminal, We will get drive angle and action to be taken. Terminal output is actually output to the controller. This program will run and our car actuators will follow stear accordingly so that the car remains inside the lane .As shown in image.  
## TERMINAL OUTPUT IMAGE
![](images/Terminal.jpg)

Hence, with the help of lanes we can control car and give directions to driver or actuator for automatic cars. Hence, in output we get driveheading in angle of turning and assistance on video frame.
## FINAL OUTPUT IMAGE
![](images/FinalOutput.jpg)

## Development Process

We will use Solo Iterative Process (SIP) for all the design and development purpose. The planning and development of this module has been split into two sprints of a week each. The product backlog, work log and iteration log can be found in the link below. Test Driven Development approach is taken for implementation and unit testing. Work is splited into two sprints according to priority and dependency. This will enable us to complete the project in defined time.At the end we will have report of actual time and planned time difference. This will enable future ventures to plan correctly.He we can define SIP as an continous improvement process.
